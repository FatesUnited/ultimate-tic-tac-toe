# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player strategy game played on a 3×3 grid of smaller Tic-Tac-Toe boards. Players take turns placing Xs and Os, with each move determining where the next player must play.

This project is a browser-based implementation built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
