  <h3>How to Play</h3>
  <div>
    Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a strategy game played on a 3×3 grid of smaller Tic-Tac-Toe boards.
    <br>
    Two players take turns placing X and O.
    <br>
    The objective is to win the game by winning three small boards in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on the big board.
  </div>
  <h3>Game Setup</h3>
  <div>
    The game board consists of 9 small Tic-Tac-Toe boards arranged in a 3×3 grid.
    <br>
    Each small board contains 9 cells.
    <br>
    Player X always goes first (Changing this is WIP).
  </div>
  <h3>Taking a Turn</h3>
  <div>
    On your turn, click an empty cell in a valid small board.
    <br>
    Your mark (X or O) is placed in that cell.
    <br>
    The position of the cell you chose determines which small board the next player must play in.
    <br>
    <em>Example:

    If you play in the top-right cell of a small board, your opponent must play in the top-right small board next.
    </em>
  </div>
  <h3>Active Board Rule</h3>
  <div>
    If the required small board is still playable, the next player must play there.
    <br>
    If the required small board has already been won or tied, the next player may play in any available small board.
    <br>
    The active small board is visually highlighted. (Still WIP)
  </div>
  <h3>Ties</h3>
  <div>
    If all cells in a small board are filled and no one has won it, that board is a tie.
    <br>
    Tied boards cannot be played in and do not count toward winning the big board.
  </div>
  <h3>Winning the Game</h3>
  <div>
    The big board is treated like a Tic-Tac-Toe board.
    <br>
    Win three small boards in a row to win the game.
    <br>
    If all small boards are completed and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a tie.
